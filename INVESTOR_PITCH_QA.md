# 🚀 JASHO - INVESTOR PITCH Q&A

---

## 🎯 PITCH QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

### 1️⃣ BUSINESS MODEL

#### Q: "What problem does Jasho solve?"

**A**: "Jasho addresses three critical problems in Kenya:

1. **Financial Exclusion**: 60% of Kenya's workforce is in the informal sector, yet only 20% have access to formal financial services.

2. **Accessibility Barriers**: 15% of Kenyans live with disabilities, and ZERO existing fintech apps in Kenya are fully accessible via voice/face recognition.

3. **Income Volatility**: Informal workers face unpredictable income with no tools to track, save, or stabilize their earnings.

Jasho provides a **voice-first, AI-powered financial platform** that works for everyone, including those who can't see, can't read, or have limited mobility."

---

#### Q: "What's your revenue model?"

**A**: "We have 5 revenue streams:

1. **Transaction Fees** (0.5-1% on deposits/withdrawals) - Industry standard
2. **Insurance Premiums** (Partnerships with insurance providers) - 15-20% commission
3. **Loan Interest** (Micro-loans at 2-3% monthly) - Competitive rates
4. **Job Marketplace Commission** (5-10% on completed gigs) - Platform fee
5. **Premium Features** (Advanced analytics, priority support) - KES 100-500/month

**Projected Revenue**: 
- Year 1: KES 50M (10,000 active users)
- Year 3: KES 500M (100,000 active users)
- Year 5: KES 2B (500,000 active users)"

---

#### Q: "Who are your target users?"

**A**: "Our primary target is **Kenya's 17 million informal sector workers**:

**Primary Segments**:
1. **Mama Mboga** (Market vendors) - 3M users
2. **Boda Boda Riders** (Motorcycle taxis) - 1.5M users
3. **Street Vendors** - 2M users
4. **Casual Laborers** (Baba fua, construction) - 4M users
5. **PWD (Persons with Disabilities)** - 2.5M users (15% of population)

**Demographics**:
- Age: 18-55 years
- Income: KES 5,000-50,000/month
- Education: Primary to Secondary
- Smartphone ownership: 70%+
- Feature phone usage: Can use USSD

**Unique Advantage**: We're the ONLY app that PWD users can use independently via voice/face."

---

### 2️⃣ MARKET & COMPETITION

#### Q: "What's your market size?"

**A**: "Kenya's fintech market presents a massive opportunity:

**TAM (Total Addressable Market)**: 
- Kenya's informal sector: 17M workers × KES 20,000 avg income = **KES 340B/month** in transaction volume
- Global informal sector: 2 billion workers = **$20 trillion market**

**SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)**:
- Urban/peri-urban Kenya: 8M workers = **KES 160B/month**
- Smartphone users: 70% = **KES 112B/month**

**SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)** - Year 5:
- 500,000 active users (3% of SAM)
- KES 10,000 avg monthly transaction
- **KES 5B/month** in transaction volume
- Revenue (1% take rate): **KES 50M/month = KES 600M/year**"

---

#### Q: "Who are your competitors?"

**A**: "We have 3 categories of competitors:

**Direct Competitors** (Mobile Money):
1. **M-Pesa** - 95% market share, but NO accessibility features, NO voice/face login
2. **Airtel Money** - 3% market share, same limitations
3. **T-Kash** - <1% market share

**Indirect Competitors** (Fintech Apps):
1. **Branch** - Loans only, NOT accessible
2. **Tala** - Loans only, NOT accessible
3. **KCB M-Pesa** - Banking, NOT accessible

**Our Competitive Advantages**:
1. ✅ **ONLY app with 100% voice/face accessibility**
2. ✅ All-in-one platform (wallet, savings, jobs, insurance)
3. ✅ AI-powered insights tailored to informal sector
4. ✅ Gamification for engagement
5. ✅ USSD support for feature phones
6. ✅ Swahili & English bilingual
7. ✅ Blockchain transparency (coming soon)

**Bottom Line**: M-Pesa has 95% market share, but **ZERO accessibility**. We own the 2.5M PWD market + ethical consumers who value inclusion."

---

#### Q: "What's your go-to-market strategy?"

**A**: "We have a 3-phase GTM strategy:

**Phase 1 - Accessibility-First Launch** (Months 1-6):
- Partner with **Kenya Association of the Blind** & **Kenya Union of the Blind**
- Launch in Nairobi & Mombasa PWD community centers
- Target: 5,000 PWD users
- Positioning: "The FIRST app that works for EVERYONE"

**Phase 2 - Informal Sector Expansion** (Months 6-18):

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**: KES 500 per user  
**Lifetime Value (LTV)**: KES 5,000 per user  
**LTV:CAC Ratio**: 10:1 (Excellent)"

---

### 3️⃣ TECHNOLOGY & PRODUCT

#### Q: "What makes your technology unique?"

**A**: "Jasho has 5 breakthrough technologies:

1. **Voice-First Architecture**:
   - Siri-like voice commands (50+ commands)
   - Voice-controlled permissions (no button tapping!)
   - Works from distance (not just close-up)
   - Feminine Kenyan voice (culturally appropriate)
   - Swahili & English bilingual

2. **AI-Powered Insights**:

   - Personalized savings recommendations
   - Spending pattern analysis
   - Fraud detection
   - Income prediction for loans

3. **Accessibility-First Design**:
   - Face recognition login (like Face ID)

   - High contrast modes
   - Large touch targets
   - No time limits

   - Optimized for low-resource devices

**Patent-Pending**: Voice-controlled permission system for financial apps"

---

#### Q: "If you're continuously listening for voice commands, what about user privacy? Are you recording everything?"

**A**: "Great question - privacy is our TOP priority. Here's how we handle it:

**1. Selective Implementation**:
- Continuous listening is **ONLY enabled for PWD users** who sign up with voice/face authentication
- Regular users get **tap-to-speak** (they tap mic button to activate)
- It's **opt-in during signup** - users explicitly consent
- Can be **toggled off anytime** in settings

**2. No Recording, No Storage**:
- We DON'T record conversations
- We DON'T store audio files
- Voice data is processed **on-device first** (local ML)
- Only command text sent to server (not audio)
- Audio deleted immediately after processing

**3. Wake Word Detection (Like Siri)**:
- App listens ONLY for wake word "Jasho"
- Everything else ignored until wake word detected
- Low-power mode (doesn't drain battery)
- Uses on-device ML (no data leaves device)

**4. Technical Implementation**:
```
User speaks → On-device wake word detection → 
If "Jasho" detected → Start recording command →
Send text (not audio) to server → Process → 
Delete all audio → Return result
```

**5. Transparency**:
- **Privacy Policy** clearly explains this
- **Indicator dot** shows when listening (like iPhone)
- **Privacy dashboard** shows all voice commands (user can audit)
- **Delete data** anytime (GDPR compliant)

**6. Competitive Advantage**:
- **Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant** all do continuous listening
- We're MORE private (local processing, opt-in only, PWD-specific)
- Industry-standard approach, just applied to fintech

**Bottom Line**: PWD users CHOOSE continuous listening for convenience. It's like choosing Face ID over password - more convenient, equally secure."
