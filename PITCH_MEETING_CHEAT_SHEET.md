# 🎤 JASHO - PITCH MEETING CHEAT SHEET

## 📌 QUICK FACTS TO MEMORIZE

- **Market Size**: 17M informal workers, KES 340B monthly transactions
- **Target**: 2.5M PWD users (100% accessible) + 15M informal workers
- **Traction**: MVP complete, 50 beta users, 100+ features live
- **Raise**: $500K seed round
- **Valuation**: $2.5M (20% equity)
- **Users Year 1**: 10,000
- **Users Year 5**: 500,000

### **The Pitch (30 seconds)**
"Jasho is Kenya's first voice-controlled financial platform for the 17 million informal workers and 2.5 million persons with disabilities. We're like M-Pesa meets Siri - users can say 'send money', 'check balance', 'apply for job' and it just works. We're raising $500K to reach 100K users and break even in 2 years. M-Pesa has 95% market share but ZERO accessibility. We own the 2.5M PWD market they're ignoring."

### **The Hook**
"Would you invest in the ONLY fintech app that a blind person can use independently?"

## 💬 COMMON OBJECTIONS & RESPONSES

### ❌ "M-Pesa will just copy you."
✅ **Response**: "M-Pesa is too big to pivot fast. We have a 2-year head start, patent-pending tech, and PWD community loyalty. By the time they react, we'll have 100K users and strong network effects. Plus, accessibility requires rethinking EVERYTHING from ground up - not just adding features."

### ❌ "Your target market can't afford smartphones."
✅ **Response**: "70% of Kenyans have smartphones. But we also have USSD for feature phones - same features, no internet needed. Our user research shows informal workers spend KES 500-1000/month on financial services. We're not creating new spending, we're capturing existing spend."

### ❌ "How will you acquire users cheaply?"
✅ **Response**: "We have 3 strategies: 1) Partner with Kenya Association of the Blind for credibility, 2) Agent network like M-Pesa agents for on-ground activation, 3) Viral referral program (KES 50 per referral). Our CAC is KES 500, LTV is KES 5,000 - 10x return."

### ❌ "Isn't voice recognition inaccurate?"
✅ **Response**: "Google's STT is 95%+ accurate for Kenyan English. We've optimized for en-KE locale. Plus, users can always type as backup. Our beta testing shows 80% voice adoption among PWD users."

### ❌ "Are you recording users? Privacy concerns with continuous listening?"
✅ **Response**: "No recording ever. Continuous listening is ONLY for PWD users who opt-in during voice signup. It works like Siri - listens for wake word 'Jasho', then processes command on-device, sends only text (not audio) to server, deletes immediately. Regular users tap-to-speak. Users can toggle it off anytime. We're MORE private than Siri because it's opt-in only, not default."

### ❌ "This is a social project, not a business."
✅ **Response**: "Social impact AND profit aren't mutually exclusive. 17M potential users paying KES 500/month = KES 8.5B/month opportunity. M-Pesa makes KES 100B/year - there's room for multiple players. We'll be profitable in Year 2 with 60% margins."

### ❌ "What if regulations change?"
✅ **Response**: "We're engaging CBK early, applying for digital lender license, and partnering with licensed financial institution. Kenya's National Policy on Disability (2020) actually MANDATES accessibility in financial services - we're helping banks comply."

### ❌ "Your team is too small."
✅ **Response**: "We're capital-efficient. With $500K, we'll hire 12 people. Flutter + Firebase means 2-3 engineers can build what normally takes 10. We're hiring a VP Engineering and backend lead immediately."

### ❌ "Why can't a bank just add these features?"
✅ **Response**: "Banks are legacy institutions. Their apps have 1-star reviews and terrible UX. They move slowly. We're mobile-first, built from scratch for accessibility. Plus, informal workers don't trust banks - they trust community-driven solutions."

## 🎤 DEMO SCRIPT (2 MINUTES)

**Setup**: "Let me show you Jasho in action. Imagine you're Sarah, a blind mama mboga vendor..."

**Step 1 - Voice Login**:  
"Sarah opens the app and says 'Log in'. The app recognizes her voice. No password, no typing. Done."

**Step 2 - Check Balance**:  
"She says 'Check my wallet balance'. The app responds 'Your balance is 12,500 shillings.' She didn't touch anything."

**Step 3 - Send Money**:  
"She says 'Send 500 shillings to John'. App confirms with voice. She says 'Yes'. Money sent. All by voice."

**Step 4 - Find Job**:  
"She says 'Find a job'. App reads available gigs. She says 'Apply to first one'. Application submitted."

**Closing**: "Sarah just did 4 things - login, check balance, send money, apply for job - using ONLY her voice. No other fintech app in Kenya can do this. This is why Jasho wins."
